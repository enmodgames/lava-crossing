# Lava Crossing

This is an entry for the 2018 Godot Community Game Jam, for which the theme was "Temperature".

At this point this "game" is a simple set of assets (generated by [Asset Forge](https://assetforge.io)) with a script demonstrating some collision behavior. I was not prepared at all to make anything one could consider "finished", but I hope you at least get some use out of the assets!
